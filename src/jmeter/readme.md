# Getting started

- still WIP

- [ ] merge script file into docker container/docker-compose (for work)
- [ ] document container and options to using it
- [ ] currently need to run script to make it work the way I want
- [ ] container works fine and can be tweaked to use mounts or embedded test .jmx

I am a fan of having the artefacts _inside_ the container and having the container run and spit out the results to a moount for uploading to the AZDO dashboard
